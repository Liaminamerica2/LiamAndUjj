# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: my solution is like a graph where the horizontal lines follow a function for every y.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: making hexagons is like drawing a picture randomly generating a world is like telling someone what the world looks like and having them draw something similar.

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: probably need something to draw lines and L shaped lines

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: a hallway is a width of one or 2 and it made up of only straight lines.
